The case of Private Bradley Manning, who leaked thousands of documents to Wikileaks in 2010, and more recently, that of former CIA analyst E. Snowden, who revealed the US's massive surveillance programs, have been compared and in some cases equated as ?whistle-blowers? acting in the interest of the public's right to government transparency. Yet some would argue that the two cases are not all comparable due to the type of information revealed. What is your view on this issue? Write an opinion essay comparing the two cases.
