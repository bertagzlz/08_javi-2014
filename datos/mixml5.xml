	<Text><![CDATA[Afghan President Hamid Karzai has said international support after foreign forces withdraw in 2014 is crucial if Afghanistan is to remain stable. His comments opened a major global conference on Afghanistan’s future in the German city of Bonn. It comes 10 years after a similar gathering held in the city, weeks after the Taliban fell from power. <u>But key player Pakistan is boycotting this round in protest at a Nato attack on a border checkpoint.</u> NATO apologized for the air strike on 26 November 2011 in which 24 Pakistani troops were killed and US President Barack Obama also offered his condolences, but Pakistan has insisted it will not reverse its decision on the talks. President Karzai hailed the progress Afghanistan has made in the decade since the last conference, but warned that such gains were by no means secure. He said the conference presented an opportunity for Afghanistan to consolidate its gains.]]></Text>

	<Text><![CDATA[The Honduran Congress has voted to ban motorcyclists from riding with passengers in a bid to curb a spate of drive-by killings. The move follows two high-profile murders this week, both blamed on gunmen on motorbikes. Honduras has the world’s highest murder rate: 82 per 100,000 people a year. During a session held in private because of security fears, legislators approved a decree limiting the number of people allowed on a motorbike to just one. The measure, which will last for six months, was requested by President Porfirio Lobo, whose government is facing rising crime. Motorcycles have been used in several high-profile murders. Honduras is a key transit country for cocaine smuggled from South America and on to the US market. <u>In November the Honduran authorities began deploying troops to carry out policing duties</u>. The police force itself is undergoing a purge amid efforts to root out officers with links to organized crime.]]></Text>

	<Text><![CDATA[Two daring commando raids by two nations in one day against Somali pirates show that some <u>naval forces are taking a harder line, perhaps because nothing else they have tried has stopped the rise of lawlessness off the east coast of Africa</u>. The raids by South Korea and Malaysia could be a sign of more aggressive tactics to come – both by navies and by pirates responding to them. Experts say pirates could increasingly use hostages as human shields if raids become more common. The European Union Naval Force refuses to raid hijacked ships out of concern for the safety of hostages, but frustration is rising. Despite patrols by an international flotilla of warships, drones patrolling the Indian Ocean and diverse strategies employed, including the sinking of pirate boats, Somali pirates have been relentless.  <br><br><b>Note: When we do something as a ‘last resort’, it usually means we don’t really want to do it but we have tried everything else and nothing else works.</b>]]></Text>

The company is also accused of profiting from selling mine assets it does not own- a claim it vehemently denies.<br>Aurora Empowerment Systems, took control of two gold mines just outside of Johannesburg around 18 months ago. Today, South Africa’s mining unions claim the company owes its workers more than 12m rand (1.8m) in unpaid salaries. The managing director of Aurora is Zondwa Gadafi Mandela, grandson of Nelson Mandela. The chairman is the nephew of President Jacob Zuma. Despite having no previous experience in the mining industry, a high court-appointed liquidator gave Aurora control of two gold mines after the previous owner went bust. Since then, the company has been at the centre of huge controversy in South Africa, with critics claiming that the company has committed multiple legal and regulatory infringements, <u>but has escaped any kind of sanction because of the significant political connections of its senior management. </u>]]></Text>

	<Text><![CDATA[<u>Japan’s government is set to suspend all cattle shipments from Fukushima as concerns over radiation-tainted beef escalate</u>. Senior Vice Health Minister Kohei Otsuka said beef from surrounding areas may also be affected. Increasing numbers of cows have been found to have consumed rice straw containing high levels of radioactive caesium. The straw was harvested from rice paddies in Fukushima prefecture after the devastating earthquake and tsunami knocked out critical cooling systems at the local nuclear plant leading to a meltdown. More than four months on, radioactive material continues to escape from the facility. Distributors across the country have bought meat from exposed cows and some of it could have already reached consumers. The major supermarket chain Aeon said that hundreds of kilos of the beef have been sold at 14 of its stores in Tokyo and the surrounding areas. The retailer said it would start to check beef shipments from all areas for contamination. The government has also acknowledged that the problem could be wider than just Fukushima.<br><br><b>Note: ‘Suspend’ is a synonym for ‘postpone’.</b>]]></Text>

	<Text><![CDATA[The man who led a legal battle which led to the recent discovery of treasure worth billions of dollars in an Indian Temple has died at the age of 70. Sundar Rajan, petitioned for the vaults of the sixteenth century temple in Kerala to be opened. Inside, investigators found gold and silver jewelry and precious stones which had been hidden for decades. Local legend had long held that vast riches had been interred in the walls and vaults of the temple. Sundar Rajan went to the Supreme Court asking that the state take over control of the temple, saying the current temple trust was incapable of protecting the wealth inside. The court ordered an inspection of the temple vaults and when inspectors broke through, they found huge amounts of treasure, including diamonds, jewelry pots and gold coins. Neither the state of Kerala nor the descendants of the royal family have made any claim on the treasure, which they say is the property of the temple and its deity. <u>But the discovery has sparked a public debate</u>, with many believing the items should be put in museums or sold and the profits used for the public good. <br><br><b>Note: ‘Contention’ here  means ‘disagreement’.</b>]]></Text>

In the poorest areas of the country, there is a severe shortage of quality play spaces for children; some areas have been described as ‘play deserts’. <u>This problem has drawn the attention of child advocates and some, but not enough, policy makers. Park and recreation budgets are often the first to be slashed when budgets are tightened. In recent years, groups like KaBOOM! have helped to fill the gap by raising private funds to finance playgrounds</u>. But KaBOOM! goes a step further: it shows locals how to organize and build playgrounds themselves.

	<Text><![CDATA[Six major US tobacco companies have defeated a lawsuit by hospitals seeking compensation for treating patients with smoking-related illnesses. Thirty-seven hospitals in the state of Missouri had claimed cigarette companies delivered an “unreasonably dangerous” product. They sought more than $455m reimbursement for treating uninsured smokers who had not paid for care. The hospitals treat many destitute, non-paying patients. They said medical ethics required them to treat people in need, regardless of their ability to pay. In the case, the hospitals claimed that tobacco companies manipulated the nicotine content in cigarettes and misrepresented the health effects of smoking. But a jury in St. Louis rejected their claim. An official from Lorillard, another company in the case, said: <u>“Compelling evidence was presented to the jury, including testimony from hospital witnesses that confirmed the hospitals were not financially damaged as they asserted.” </u>]]></Text>

It started like a typical Washington DC function. Men and women in dark suits milled around a formal room in the Swiss Embassy.  But after a series of speeches, guests were led to the back of the room, and into an entirely different experience. They had entered Hemingway’s, a bar celebrating the American writer who made his home in Cuba. There, the floors were covered in terracotta tile, while wooden fans whirred above. Bartenders poured cocktails under a brass replica of Hemingway’s signature.

Quickly tracked down and arrested by his fellow officers, he told them that he was up to his neck in debts as he lost everything at video poker. Bizarre stories like this are popping up more often as Italians develop a serious gambling habit. Italy has now moved into the number one spot for gambling in Europe after overtaking the U.K. <u>The boom has been driven by the legalization of slot machines which have overtaken lotteries, horses and football to account for more than half of today’s total spending. </u> “Until the 1990s it was disapproved of and the government’s tendency was to control it,” said sociologist Maurizio Fiasco. “Then it became a useful revenue.” While the gambling parlors provide a revenue for the cash-strapped government, <u>the mafia has also moved in for its cut – allegedly using front companies to obtain licenses then laundering drug money through operations. </u><br><br><b>Note: ‘Front companies’ are ‘false companies’ and the mafia’s ‘cut’ means its profit.</b>]]></Text>

Today the country has a national digital telephone network and universal access to health and education, which are largely funded by the government. Botswana has mineral wealth, mainly in the form of diamonds, as well as political stability. But these alone cannot explain why Botswana has fared so much better than many countries with similar starting positions. <u>Along with efficient macroeconomic management, a key lesson from the Botswana experience is ensuring that economic growth translates into tangible social benefits for all. </u>It means that growth needs to create jobs and incomes and that it must extend to the poorest in society. It also means that growth must lead to improvements in public services, particularly in health and education. This is not easy and in rural communities in Botswana, poverty remains at unacceptably high levels. For a number of reasons, many African countries continue to rely on the export of primary commodities rather than value addition and diversification of the economic base. <u>The resultant capital-intensive growth has little direct effect on employment levels and few linkages to employment-intensive sectors such as agriculture. Thus, it is no wonder that despite years of strong economic growth, poverty remains so pervasive in so many resource-rich countries on the continent. </u>]]></Text>

But all that’s about to change, after the government voted to allow sales of the drink nicknamed the “green fairy”.                                                      “I will not be seen as a drug addict anymore,” says Clement Arnoux, an absinthe drinker. The green, anise-flavoured spirit is associated with many of the country’s most famous and esteemed artists and writers but it was banned in France in 1915 for its alleged harmful effect. <u>Later, the rule was relaxed, allowing the drink to be sold as long as it was not called absinthe, </u>and instead labelled “a spirit made from extracts of the absinthe plant.” Now the ban is expected to be lifted entirely any day now, after the French Senate voted in favour of the move in mid-April. <u>While drinkers like Clement Arnoux are relieved that the stigma of illegality has gone, not everyone sees the change of law as cause for celebration. </u>Absinthe is usually around 60 or 70% alcohol, though it is not designed to be drunk neat, but mixed instead with water.

Rivers levels were at historic lows and the impact on wildlife was severe. The number of pink river dolphins in a remote part of the Peruvian Amazon dropped by nearly half in October compared with 2009, as the level of the Samiria River, a major tributary of the Amazon, fell. Along a 20km stretch of the river, a population of 250 declined to about 140.But now a team of conservation experts working in the region has found that many species have recovered more quickly than expected. <u>This includes the pink dolphins, which, according to surveys conducted in March, have seen their numbers increased by nearly 10%, compared to the same period last year, prior to the drought</u>. The number of grey dolphins is also up from March 2010 – by 30%. The research is being carried out in a national reserve in the Amazon. <u>“This reserve is flooded forest, where we get high levels and low levels in the rivers every year,” says Dr. Bodmer. </u> “But the 2010 drought and the record floods the previous year were much worse.” Now the water levels are extremely high again and local officials have declared a state of emergency. <u>“We are being hit on both sides – extremely high levels of water or droughts,” says Dr. Bodmer. </u><br><br><b>Note: The second two pieces of underlined text answer both answer the second question.</b>]]></Text>
