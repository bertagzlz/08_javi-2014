<question nquest="1">
	<Text><![CDATA[Csilla from Hungary tells about how she found her cat. I first saw Mandula last summer along a busy road. She was begging people for food. The poor cat was all skin and bones at that time. She was starving. Mandula was also pregnant. Thus, I decided to look after her immediately. Two weeks after I brought her into my home, Mandula gave birth to six beautiful and playful kittens. Those kittens have grown up and are living in different homes. And, Mandula  whose name means almond in Hungarian  is now a happy cat who likes to watch television with me every evening.]]></Text>

	<Text><![CDATA[News about The Iron Curtain. According to a report in Germanys Der Spiegel magazine, the land once known as the Iron Curtain may be protected. The Iron Curtain was a term used to describe the border between Eastern and Western Europe from 1945 to 1990. In Germany, the Iron Curtain stretched 1,400 kilometers and was covered in wire and mines. Although this land was uninhabitable for humans, it was a good place for
wildlife including black storks, otters and bats  to exist. Now the governments of 16 states in Germany may decide to protect this area by not
allowing the development of roads and buildings in it.]]></Text>

	<Text><![CDATA[Horoscope: Taurus. The sign Taurus is ruled by Venus. Physically it is related to the throat. It is said to have a feminine nature, and is therefore more passive and receptive in its energy expression. Taurus is an Earth sign and as such is connected with fruitfulness and stability. A planet placed in this sign will be a stabilizing influence and manifest its energy in a steadfast and determined manner. Taurus is also a fixed sign, and this means that once a course is embarked on, it is rarely deviated from. Maintenance and care of existing conditions over long periods of time, and a reluctance to initiate change, are qualities of this sign.]]></Text>

	<Text><![CDATA[Biomass as a carbon-neutral energy source. As we struggle to meet our renewable-energy goals, we ought to embrace biomass. Biomass energy is positively carbon-neutral. Burning agricultural waste or forest residue to generate electricity releases no more carbon dioxide than if those materials simply decayed. Furthermore, biomass energy reduces the need to burn fossil fuels, and the less fossil fuel we burn the more we reduce our carbon footprint. But that hasnt stopped fear-mongering aimed at denying biomass credit as a cleanenergy source. Claims that biomass energy is anything but carbon-neutral ignore the fact that not all carbon is created equal, at least in terms of the global carbon cycle. When fossil fuels are burned to produce energy, there is a net increase in carbon released to the atmosphere, because it takes carbon that was stored safely underground and adds it to the atmosphere. Biomass energy, however, deals with biogenic carbon - carbon that is already part of the atmospheric system. Theres no carbon added because the carbon in question is already part of the global-carbon cycle. So even if more carbon dioxide goes up a biomass-energy power-plant smokestack than a coal-fired power-plant smokestack, its OK because one is relatively harmless and the other relatively harmful. As regulators debate what should and shouldnt be considered renewable energy sources, they should focus on encouraging investment to reduce emissions and our dependence on fossil fuels. Most of all, science should trump irrational fears. Its time to give biomass the credit it is due.]]></Text>

Like the 10,000 bacteria you inhale with each breath in the average office building. Or the 10 million bacteria in each glass of tap water. Microbiologists have now added something else to the list of things too gross to contemplate: the deluge of bacteria that hit your face and flow deep into your lungs in the morning shower. This unwelcome peek behind the shower curtain has been provided by a group of microbiologists at the University of Colorado using a new type of test. Conventional tests depend on growing cultures of the bacteria to be identified, but because most species cannot be grown in the laboratory, a majority of bacterial species are missed. The new method examines the genetic material directly, without the need for culturing bacteria. As part of a project to measure microbes in the indoor human environment, they looked at shower water, in part because in showers bacteria are incorporated into fine droplets that can be breathed deep into the lungs. The bacteria get into shower heads from the water and build up there, so the dose is highest when the shower is first turned on. Running the water for 30 seconds before stepping in would mean fewer bacteria in ones face. Also, the bacteria seem to find metal shower heads a less hospitable niche than plastic ones.]]></Text>

	<Text><![CDATA[A film critics assessment of the "youth culture" in Hollywood: The 23-year old Shia LaBeouf, without meaning to do so, has become a metaphor for
how youth culture - after decades of elbowing its way to the forefront - now almost entirely dominates the culture itself. One day, he was a Disney kid, starring on cables "Even Stevens" and in the movie "Holes", and then suddenly, Steven Spielberg turned him into an action star in the latest "Indiana Jones" film. LaBeoufs rise owes a great deal to his own charisma and charm, of course, but the actors ubiquity represents a slightly off-putting new paradigm in Hollywood: Young viewers want to see young stars, as they always have, but older viewers - the ones who can still be bothered to see movies in theaters - want to see young stars as well. The disturbing part is that those older audiences seem to have lost most of their interest in films about people their own age. Many recent "adult dramas" have flopped at the box office. And while a case can be made that those individual films had flaws that had nothing to do with their target demographic, their disappointing returns are endemic of a larger cultural trend wherein youth is valued above all else and maturity is, well, boring. For the studios, this winds up as a win-win; younger stars with shorter careers dont cost as much as a older, more established stars. And when audiences vote with their dollars for the newcomers over the veterans, that ensures a healthier profit margin.]]></Text>

	<Text><![CDATA[The following is an article about the possibility of providing health insurance to illegal immigrants in the U.S.: The question of giving health insurance to undocumented workers is ethically murky and politically impossible. Some people argue that if were hiring illegals to, say, shingle our roofs, we have a moral obligation to care for them if they fall off. But more people simply want them out of the country. Given that illegal immigrants have, by definition, broken our laws, it makes sense that large numbers of upstanding citizens oppose any measure that would encourage more foreigners to sneak into America or make their lives easier once theyre here. The only problem? From a purely economic standpoint, insuring illegal immigrants makes a lot of sense - and not just for them, but for everyone. Immigrants typically arrive in America during their prime working years and tend to be younger and healthier than the rest of the U.S. population. As a result, health-care expenditures for the average immigrant are lower than for a native-born American citizen with similar characteristics. It stands to reason that including the relatively healthy,relatively employable and largely uninsured illegal population in some sort of universal health-care system would be a boon rather than a burden. "Insurance in principle has to cover the average medical cost of all the people its serving," explains a professor of health policy. "So if you add cheaper people to the pool, like immigrants, you reduce the average cost." More undocumented workers, in other words, means lower premiums for everyone. And, since most illegal workers stay only long enough to save enough money to support their families in their home
countries, they leave before becoming a burden on the system.]]></Text>

	<Text><![CDATA[The decline of handwriting: Recently, two journalists wrote a newspaper article about the decline of handwriting. By now its well-known: most kids - what with computers and text messages - can no longer write by hand, except in laboured capital letters. The crisis began with the advent of the ballpoint pen. Early ballpoints were very messy and if, immediately after writing, you ran your finger over the last few words, a smudge inevitably appeared. So, people no longer felt much interest in writing well, since handwriting, when produced with a ballpoint, even a clean one, no longer had soul, style or personality. Why should we regret the passing of good handwriting? The capacity to write well and quickly on a keyboard encourages rapid thought, and often the spell-checker will underline a misspelling. However, handwriting teaches us to control our hands and encourages hand-eye coordination. Writing by hand obliges us to compose the phrase mentally before writing it down. Thanks to the resistance of pen and paper, it does make one slow down and think. Its true that kids will write more and more on computers and cellphones.
Nonetheless, humanity has learned to rediscover as sports and aesthetic pleasures many things that civilisation had eliminated as unnecessary. People no longer travel on horseback but some go to a riding school; motor yachts exist but many people are devoted to sailing; there are tunnels but many still enjoy walking or climbing Alpine passes. It would be a good thing if parents sent kids off to handwriting schools so they could
take part in competitions and tournaments - not only to acquire grounding in what is beautiful, but also for psychomotor wellbeing.]]></Text>

	<Text><![CDATA[A Canadian journalists appraisal of the relationship between the U.S. and Canada: Anti-Americanism has been Canadas defining intellectual ailment for generations. Not the fire-breathing hatred felt in some parts of the world, or even the elitist sneer directed westward from across the Atlantic; it was always a more neighborly, eyerolling disapproval that reached its zenith under George W. Bush. The Canadian press bristled with shrill attacks on the neoconservative agenda. That was then. Suddenly Canadian attitudes have matured at a breakneck pace - and not just because Americans elected Barack Obama (though of course thats a part of it). Canadian anti-Americanism is fueled, fundamentally, by envy and fear. But
over the past year, the United States has been laid low by a devastating financial collapse. Canadas economy, on the other hand, has escaped relatively unscathed. Its banking and real-estate sectors have been models of well-regulated stability compared with their American counterparts. The World Economic Forum proclaimed Canada to have the soundest banking system on the entire planet. Whatever Canadians think about the direction of the United States under Obama, few of them are still worried about American billionaires buying up their country lock, stock, and
barrel. America has long been lampooned by Canadian social critics as a throwback to a cruel, bygone era of laissez-faire capitalism. But under the Democratic Congress and White House, the governments role in the economy has surged. The overall result is that the Canadian and American approaches to the size of government are beginning to converge. This healing trend comes primarily as an unintended effect of recent developments in Washington and on Wall Street. But its also a sign that Canada has grown up.]]></Text>

	<Text><![CDATA[Global warming and population control: As related by the Washington Post, two recent studies have pointed out that the real culprit for global warming isnt cars or coal plants, its us. There are too many humans on planet Earth. The cheapest cure is contraception, according to a study
released by the London School of Economics, which points out that each $7 spent on family planning over the next four decades would reduce carbon-dioxide emissionsby more than a ton. Achieving the same result with low-carbon technologies would cost at least $32. I think Ive got the answer to climate change: a cap-and-trade program for babies., OK, maybe not. But the notion is only a little sillier than the solution being promoted by the London School. Their model for fighting climate change by promoting birth control in the Third World ignores the fact that such programs almost never work. There are many reasons for the population explosion, but most of them come down to one factor: poverty. Women in poor countries have almost no power over reproductive decisions and are encouraged to have more children in places where infant mortality is high, so they go from one pregnancy to the next. Programs to promote condoms arent going to change any of this; if you want to lower birth rates
you have to reduce poverty. That means investing in development for poor countries. Of course, with development come higher greenhouse gas emissions. But there is a solution for this new problem as well: make these societies grow green with the help of new clean-energy technologies developed in the U.S. and other rich countries.]]></Text>

	<Text><![CDATA[A journalists investigation into Californias financial situation: California, the state that once boasted the best schools and highways in America
now has some of the worst. Its healthcare is ranked lowest of all the 50 states; its public finances are a disaster. Year after year, its legislature has failed to agree a budget. Its deficits make Italy look like a paragon of fiscal prudence. The government of one of the most richly endowed territories on earth, a crucible of innovation and the eighth largest economy in the world, is broke. Why has California got into such a mess? Some analysts say: "Too much democracy!" In Californias eccentric version of direct democracy, all kinds of extravagant public spending are mandated by initiatives, proposed by anyone who can gather enough signatures, and passed by a simple majority of those who bother to vote on them, while the states revenue-gathering possibilities are curbed by the same method. Yet its not fair to blame all this on government of the people by the people. Rather, California shows how such experiments in direct democracy can be perverted. For this framework of initiatives was established by self-styled progressives in the early 20th century to curb the power of the railway bosses and bring power to the people. A hundred years later, it is todays diverse special-interest groups - not just billionaires and businesses but also powerful public service unions - who play the system to feather their own nests or further their own fads. They hire hands to collect signatures on their chosen initiative, and use advertising muscle to whip in the votes.

	<Text><![CDATA[A UK journalists opinion on the opening of an expensive veterinary health centre: Humans are a selfish species - we breed and domesticate millions of animals for our own purposes of companionship and control, and then we complain if "too much" money is spent on their medical treatment. It doesnt seem too much to have one state of the art veterinary centre for animals serving the whole of the UK. All modern medical treatment is expensive. The £15 million needed to operate the centre is a lot of money, but it pales in comparison with the annual National Health
Service budget of £110 billion. We abandon, neglect, maltreat, and euthanize (for our own convenience) hundreds of thousands every year. Our use of companion animals comes at a high cost to them in terms of their welfare and premature death. It only seems reasonable that we should pay something back for all their love and devotion. We need to bear in mind that these creatures wouldnt exist if it wasnt for us. Often I am asked to respond to this loaded question: "Is it right to have these facilities for animals while humans face waiting lists?" We could equally ask this loaded question: "Is it right to spend an annual NHS budget of £110 billion on humans when other sentient species, equally capable of suffering pain, fear, distress, anxiety, terror - domestic animals which we have brought into being and to whom we have a duty of care - are only given a tiny fraction

	<Text><![CDATA[The truthfulness of documentary films: A recent report on documentary films had a message for those who look to those films for guidance about matters as serious as business, politics, nature and the meaning of life: let the viewer beware. Based on anonymous interviews with 45 longform
documentary filmmakers, the study came to some conclusions that could shock those schooled in conventional journalistic ethics. The report found that documentarians, while they generally aspire to act honourably, often operate under ad hoc ethical codes. The craft tends to see itself as being bound less by the need to be accurate and fair than by a desire for social justice, to level the playing field between those who are perceived to be powerful and those who are not. That often means manipulating individual facts, sequences and meanings of images, said the report, if that might help viewers to grasp the documentarys higher truth. Deception in pursuit of a good story is acceptable to some. For example, one documentarian
acknowledged letting film crew members break the legs of rabbits in order to get better shots of animals being hunted by others in the wild. Other filmmakers said that corporate executives and celebrities were entitled to less protection as interview subjects than more sympathetic individuals. "Everybody who makes a movie, documentary or otherwise, is motivated by passion and point of view", said one documentary filmmaker. "But, they are hindered by the need for access, financial resources and the realities of seeking an audience."]]></Text>

	<Text><![CDATA[A scientists appraisal of the state of space exploration: Neil Armstrongs first small step for man was widely believed to be the start of a long
and glorious road to the stars. Forty years after the first Moon landing, the dream has faded. Astronauts have been stuck in low-Earth orbit, boldly going nowhere. American attempts to kick-start a new phase of lunar exploration have stalled amid the realisation that NASA´s budget is too small for the job. Clearly, some creative thinking is badly needed if humans are to have a future beyond Earth. Returning to the Moon may be worthy and attainable, but it fails to capture the publics imagination. What does get people excited is the prospect of a mission to Mars. The lure of the red planet lies in its Earth-like conditions and the tantalising prospect of some form of life. Unfortunately, existing plans are absurdly expensive and will remain unrealistic for decades. But there is a way to put humans on Mars with foreseeable technology, and at a fraction of the projected cost. Five years ago I made the radical proposal that a handful of astronauts be sent on a one-way journey to Mars. I am not talking about a suicide mission. With its protective atmosphere, accessible water and carbon dioxide, and significant amounts of methane, Mars is one of the few places in the solar system that could support a human colony. I have presented my idea at NASA conferences, and discussed it with scientists in
other countries. The response has nearly always been positive. There is a persistent myth that nobody would volunteer to go. In fact, I have found no shortage of eager scientists, young and old, who say they would accept a one-way ticket.]]></Text>
