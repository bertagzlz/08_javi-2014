<h1>Color Scheme Designer</h1>

<h4 id="news">NEWS</h4>

<p>
	<strong>May 1, 2010:</strong> Finally, we're working on the next version of Color Scheme Designer (CSD) and preparing many major improvements. There will be a brand new API allowing you to use CSD as a widget within your own web sites, call server queries, and much more. We're also going to create downloadable versions of CSD: for Windows, Mac and even iPhone. Although we planned these for autumn 2009, things became complicated and we have to delay everything. Anyway, now we're really starting the development again and looking forward to this summer for new features. Thank you for your patience.
