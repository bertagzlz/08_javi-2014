<question nquest="1">
	<Text><![CDATA[Afghan President Hamid Karzai has said international support after foreign forces withdraw in 2014 is crucial if Afghanistan is to remain stable. His comments opened a major global conference on Afghanistan’s future in the German city of Bonn. It comes 10 years after a similar gathering held in the city, weeks after the Taliban fell from power. But key player Pakistan is boycotting this round in protest at a Nato attack on a border checkpoint. NATO apologized for the air strike on 26 November 2011 in which 24 Pakistani troops were killed and US President Barack Obama also offered his condolences, but Pakistan has insisted it will not reverse its decision on the talks. President Karzai hailed the progress Afghanistan has made in the decade since the last conference, but warned that such gains were by no means secure. He said the conference presented an opportunity for Afghanistan to consolidate its gains.]]></Text>

	<Text><![CDATA[The Honduran Congress has voted to ban motorcyclists from riding with passengers in a bid to curb a spate of drive-by killings. The move follows two high-profile murders this week, both blamed on gunmen on motorbikes. Honduras has the world’s highest murder rate: 82 per 100,000 people a year. During a session held in private because of security fears, legislators approved a decree limiting the number of people allowed on a motorbike to just one. The measure, which will last for six months, was requested by President Porfirio Lobo, whose government is facing rising crime. Motorcycles have been used in several high-profile murders. Honduras is a key transit country for cocaine smuggled from South America and on to the US market. In November the Honduran authorities began deploying troops to carry out policing duties. The police force itself is undergoing a purge amid efforts to root out officers with links to organized crime.]]></Text>

	<Text><![CDATA[Two daring commando raids by two nations in one day against Somali pirates show that some naval forces are taking a harder line, perhaps because nothing else they have tried has stopped the rise of lawlessness off the east coast of Africa. The raids by South Korea and Malaysia could be a sign of more aggressive tactics to come – both by navies and by pirates responding to them. Experts say pirates could increasingly use hostages as human shields if raids become more common. The European Union Naval Force refuses to raid hijacked ships out of concern for the safety of hostages, but frustration is rising. Despite patrols by an international flotilla of warships, drones patrolling the Indian Ocean and diverse strategies employed, including the sinking of pirate boats, Somali pirates have been relentless. Note: When we do something as a ‘last resort’, it usually means we don’t really want to do it but we have tried everything else and nothing else works.]]></Text>

	<Text><![CDATA[A South African gold mining company owned by members of the Mandela and Zuma families is accused of exploiting its political connections to avoid punishment over its abuse of workers. The company is also accused of profiting from selling mine assets it does not own- a claim it vehemently denies.                                                                                                                                                            Aurora Empowerment Systems, took control of two gold mines just outside of Johannesburg around 18 months ago. Today, South Africa’s mining unions claim the company owes its workers more than 12m rand (1.8m) in unpaid salaries. The managing director of Aurora is Zondwa Gadafi Mandela, grandson of Nelson Mandela. The chairman is the nephew of President Jacob Zuma. Despite having no previous experience in the mining industry, a high court-appointed liquidator gave Aurora control of two gold mines after the previous owner went bust. Since then, the company has been at the centre of huge controversy in South Africa, with critics claiming that the company has committed multiple legal and regulatory infringements, but has escaped any kind of sanction because of the significant political connections of its senior management.]]></Text>

	<Text><![CDATA[Japan’s government is set to suspend all cattle shipments from Fukushima as concerns over radiation-tainted beef escalate. Senior Vice Health Minister Kohei Otsuka said beef from surrounding areas may also be affected. Increasing numbers of cows have been found to have consumed rice straw containing high levels of radioactive caesium. The straw was harvested from rice paddies in Fukushima prefecture after the devastating earthquake and tsunami knocked out critical cooling systems at the local nuclear plant leading to a meltdown. More than four months on, radioactive material continues to escape from the facility. Distributors across the country have bought meat from exposed cows and some of it could have already reached consumers. The major supermarket chain Aeon said that hundreds of kilos of the beef have been sold at 14 of its stores in Tokyo and the surrounding areas. The retailer said it would start to check beef shipments from all areas for contamination. The government has also acknowledged that the problem could be wider than just Fukushima. Note: ‘Suspend’ is a synonym for ‘postpone’.]]></Text>

	<Text><![CDATA[The man who led a legal battle which led to the recent discovery of treasure worth billions of dollars in an Indian Temple has died at the age of 70. Sundar Rajan, petitioned for the vaults of the sixteenth century temple in Kerala to be opened. Inside, investigators found gold and silver jewelry and precious stones which had been hidden for decades. Local legend had long held that vast riches had been interred in the walls and vaults of the temple. Sundar Rajan went to the Supreme Court asking that the state take over control of the temple, saying the current temple trust was incapable of protecting the wealth inside. The court ordered an inspection of the temple vaults and when inspectors broke through, they found huge amounts of treasure, including diamonds, jewelry pots and gold coins. Neither the state of Kerala nor the descendants of the royal family have made any claim on the treasure, which they say is the property of the temple and its deity. But the discovery has sparked a public debate, with many believing the items should be put in museums or sold and the profits used for the public good. Note: ‘Contention’ here  means ‘disagreement’.]]></Text>

	<Text><![CDATA[I recently reported on an organization called KaBOOM! which helps residents in low-income communities across the United States build playgrounds and take steps towards re-creating their communities. In the poorest areas of the country, there is a severe shortage of quality play spaces for children; some areas have been described as ‘play deserts’. This problem has drawn the attention of child advocates and some, but not enough, policy makers. Park and recreation budgets are often the first to be slashed when budgets are tightened. In recent years, groups like KaBOOM! have helped to fill the gap by raising private funds to finance playgrounds. But KaBOOM! goes a step further: it shows locals how to organize and build playgrounds themselves. If each generation of citizens has to rediscover its capacity for societal renewal, the past can certainly serve as a guide. Why did community playgrounds and children’s vegetable gardens end? Note: The statement is saying that KaBooM raised private funds in response to budget cuts]]></Text>

	<Text><![CDATA[Six major US tobacco companies have defeated a lawsuit by hospitals seeking compensation for treating patients with smoking-related illnesses. Thirty-seven hospitals in the state of Missouri had claimed cigarette companies delivered an “unreasonably dangerous” product. They sought more than $455m reimbursement for treating uninsured smokers who had not paid for care. The hospitals treat many destitute, non-paying patients. They said medical ethics required them to treat people in need, regardless of their ability to pay. In the case, the hospitals claimed that tobacco companies manipulated the nicotine content in cigarettes and misrepresented the health effects of smoking. But a jury in St. Louis rejected their claim. An official from Lorillard, another company in the case, said: “Compelling evidence was presented to the jury, including testimony from hospital witnesses that confirmed the hospitals were not financially damaged as they asserted.”]]></Text>

Jaycee’s American accent is so convincing that the US caller is almost certainly unaware that he’s on the other side of the world, in the Philippines. It’s this accent coupled with the high number of fluent English speakers that is making the Philippines the new destination of choice for international companies wanting to outsource their call centers. “In voice-based business, we really excel,” says Bong Borja , the Philippine president of a call center  company. To American ears, Filipinos often sound clearer than agents in India – the king of the call centre industry. Mr. Borja says. “That’s the reason some companies in India are moving to the Philippines.” Some are even run by Indians, and many employ a high number of Indian expatriates on their management staff. People with these management skills “can only be found in India – they have the expertise and they were there a couple of years ahead of us,” says Mr. Borja.]]></Text>

	<Text><![CDATA[Cuban and American politicians have celebrated together at the opening of Hemingway’s, an invitation –only bar located in a Washington DC embassy. It started like a typical Washington DC function. Men and women in dark suits milled around a formal room in the Swiss Embassy.  But after a series of speeches, guests were led to the back of the room, and into an entirely different experience. They had entered Hemingway’s, a bar celebrating the American writer who made his home in Cuba. There, the floors were covered in terracotta tile, while wooden fans whirred above. Bartenders poured cocktails under a brass replica of Hemingway’s signature. Aside from the fact that it serves liquor, Hemingway’s isn’t a bar in the traditional sense. Tucked inside the embassy, where the Cuban Interests Section resides, the bar has a strict invitation-only list. It will be used for entertaining guests of the Interest Section, so tourists hoping to catch happy hour are out of luck. It’s illegal for the bar to conduct any commerce, but the embassy is free from the trade embargo that forbids importing products from the communist country. So drinks were free, made with Cuban rum that’s normally impossible to find in the U.S. Note: The first question is answered in the last sentence and the answer to the second question appears earlier in the text.]]></Text>

	<Text><![CDATA[Last December a policeman in a small town near Rome put on a balaclava, kidnapped his neighbor’s teenage son and demanded an 85,000 euro ransom. Quickly tracked down and arrested by his fellow officers, he told them that he was up to his neck in debts as he lost everything at video poker. Bizarre stories like this are popping up more often as Italians develop a serious gambling habit. Italy has now moved into the number one spot for gambling in Europe after overtaking the U.K. The boom has been driven by the legalization of slot machines which have overtaken lotteries, horses and football to account for more than half of today’s total spending. “Until the 1990s it was disapproved of and the government’s tendency was to control it,” said sociologist Maurizio Fiasco. “Then it became a useful revenue.” While the gambling parlors provide a revenue for the cash-strapped government, the mafia has also moved in for its cut – allegedly using front companies to obtain licenses then laundering drug money through operations. Note: ‘Front companies’ are ‘false companies’ and the mafia’s ‘cut’ means its profit.]]></Text>

For a 30-pound annual fee, 10,000 farm followers will help manage Wimpole Home Farm, in Cambridgeshire. The ‘My Farm’ project aims to reconnect people with where their food comes from. It was partly inspired by the online Face book game Farmville and follows the example of Ebbsfleet Football Club which is run on a similar basis. Wimpole Home Farm, which is converting to organic, is currently commercially self-sustaining. The 1,200 acre site is home to rare breeds of sheep, cattle, poultry, horses and goats and produces meat, eggs, wheat and oil seed rape. Subscribers will be expected to make key decisions on which crops to plant, which animals to buy and whether to put in measures such as new hedgerows to help wildlife. They will be asked to make 12 major monthly decisions during the course of the year as well as other choices. The options put to members will be within parameters dictated by climate, legislation, and the requirements of the environmental stewardship scheme which the farm is signed up to, as well as the heritage protection given to the estate.]]></Text>

But it seems villagers in Uravi, high in the Caucasus mountains in north-west Georgia, are being kept in the dark and locals know nothing about the harm the pollution could be doing to their young. The government is aware of the problem, but with its economy still only 60% of what it was in Soviet times, the country just does not have the necessary resources, says environment minister Giorgi Khachidze. “All over the country we have the legacy of pesticides, landmines, abandoned factories, sources of radiation. Every day we get information about something and we just don’t have the money to sort out all these in a day.” Uravi is a beautiful spot, where hills dotted with small wooden houses rise up form the river to peaks covered in snow. But locals call this the Black Valley. Zaza Bochirishvili, who runs a local NGO campaigning on green issues, says the whole area is polluted. “All mountain rivers should have fish in them but this river does not.” Recent tests show arsenic levels in the soil around the village are 20-30 times higher than normal. Other scientific studies have found arsenic in the blood of local children. Note: The first part of the underlined text answers the second question. If someone is ‘kept in the dark’,  about something, they are not informed about it. The second sentence of underlined text answers the first question as it refers to the country not having enough resources. This is reinforced later by the speaker who says ‘ We just don’t have enough money.’]]></Text>

	<Text><![CDATA[When Botswana achieved independence in 1966, it was one of Africa’s poorest countries with few schools or hospitals and only a handful of university graduates. Today the country has a national digital telephone network and universal access to health and education, which are largely funded by the government. Botswana has mineral wealth, mainly in the form of diamonds, as well as political stability. But these alone cannot explain why Botswana has fared so much better than many countries with similar starting positions. Along with efficient macroeconomic management, a key lesson from the Botswana experience is ensuring that economic growth translates into tangible social benefits for all. It means that growth needs to create jobs and incomes and that it must extend to the poorest in society. It also means that growth must lead to improvements in public services, particularly in health and education. This is not easy and in rural communities in Botswana, poverty remains at unacceptably high levels. For a number of reasons, many African countries continue to rely on the export of primary commodities rather than value addition and diversification of the economic base. The resultant capital-intensive growth has little direct effect on employment levels and few linkages to employment-intensive sectors such as agriculture. Thus, it is no wonder that despite years of strong economic growth, poverty remains so pervasive in so many resource-rich countries on the continent.]]></Text>

	<Text><![CDATA[Global warming has already harmed the world’s food production and has driven up food prices by as much as 20% over recent decades, new research has revealed. The drop in the productivity of crop plants around the world was not caused by changes in rainfall but was because higher temperatures can cause dehydration, prevent pollination and lead to slowed photosynthesis.                                                                                                                                                             Lester Brown, president of the Earth Policy Institute, said the findings indicate a turning point: “Agriculture as it exists today evolved over 11,000 years of reasonably stable climate, but that climate system is no more. Adaptation is difficult because our knowledge of the future is not strong enough to drive new investments”, he said. “So we just keep going, hoping for the best.” The scientists say their work shows how crucial it is to find ways to adapt farming to a warmer world, to ensure that rises in global population are matched by rising food production. “It is vital,” said Wolfram Schlenker, one of the research team. “If we continue to have the same seed varieties and temperatures continue to rise, then food prices will rise further. Addressing that is the big question.”]]></Text>

	<Text><![CDATA[Green, incredibly alcoholic and some say mind-altering-these are the qualities that led to absinthe being banned in France almost 100 years ago. But all that’s about to change, after the government voted to allow sales of the drink nicknamed the “green fairy”.                                                      “I will not be seen as a drug addict anymore,” says Clement Arnoux, an absinthe drinker. The green, anise-flavoured spirit is associated with many of the country’s most famous and esteemed artists and writers but it was banned in France in 1915 for its alleged harmful effect. Later, the rule was relaxed, allowing the drink to be sold as long as it was not called absinthe, and instead labelled “a spirit made from extracts of the absinthe plant.” Now the ban is expected to be lifted entirely any day now, after the French Senate voted in favour of the move in mid-April. While drinkers like Clement Arnoux are relieved that the stigma of illegality has gone, not everyone sees the change of law as cause for celebration. Absinthe is usually around 60 or 70% alcohol, though it is not designed to be drunk neat, but mixed instead with water. For some, the drink’s high proof is part of its appeal. Young people are “always looking for something more,” says Laurent Legay, who works with people with drink problems. Note: The second question is answered by the first piece of underlined text. The use of ‘ as long as’ indicates that there is a special condition. The first question is answered by the second piece of underlined text.]]></Text>

	<Text><![CDATA[Several months ago, parts of the Amazon rainforest were in the grip of one of the most severe droughts on record. Rivers levels were at historic lows and the impact on wildlife was severe. The number of pink river dolphins in a remote part of the Peruvian Amazon dropped by nearly half in October compared with 2009, as the level of the Samiria River, a major tributary of the Amazon, fell. Along a 20km stretch of the river, a population of 250 declined to about 140.But now a team of conservation experts working in the region has found that many species have recovered more quickly than expected. This includes the pink dolphins, which, according to surveys conducted in March, have seen their numbers increased by nearly 10%, compared to the same period last year, prior to the drought. The number of grey dolphins is also up from March 2010 – by 30%. The research is being carried out in a national reserve in the Amazon. “This reserve is flooded forest, where we get high levels and low levels in the rivers every year,” says Dr. Bodmer. “But the 2010 drought and the record floods the previous year were much worse.” Now the water levels are extremely high again and local officials have declared a state of emergency. “We are being hit on both sides – extremely high levels of water or droughts,” says Dr. Bodmer.

But 20-year-old Kanthoop is not just another university student. She has been spat at, publicly denigrated, threatened by police and faces up to 15 years in jail for little more, she says, than “having opinions.” To understand why Kanthoop might be so vilified is to understand Thai society. Twice a day time stands still in this nation of 69 million as the national anthem sputters out of public loudspeakers and everyone stands in silent salute. The routine testifies to the adoration Thai people feel for both their nation and their king. But that reverence is backed up by the world’s strictest pro-monarchy regulations, which sentences anyone who insults, defames or threatens the king to three to fifteen years imprisonment. Opponents argue that the law, known as Article 112, prevents healthy dialogue and is being used as a political tool to stifle dissent. Human rights groups, as well as the U.S, E.U. and U.N, have voiced concern over the way the law is used. Note: The first piece of underlined text answers the second question. We know that the royal family is venerated because of the use of words such as ‘adoration’ and ‘reverence’. The first question is answered by the second piece of underlined text.]]></Text>
