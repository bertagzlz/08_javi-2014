<question nquest="1" Question="1. The feral child  
For the first seven years of her life, Daniele never saw the sun. She was cooped up in a tiny filthy room in a clapboard shack. She couldn’t speak and recoiled from human contact. American media called her the -feral child-. Danny was taken into care but adoption workers were convinced no one would want to take on the challenge. They hadn’t  reckoned on Diane and Bernie .. who adopted Dani and have now written a book about the experience. It started when the couple attended an adoption event in Florida looking for a companion for their youngest son William. Diane told me they were captivated by a grainy, black and white photograph of Dani pinned to the wall. 
Diane : -Her  eyes were just haunting. There was just something about them that made me want to know more about her. 
Int: But when you started asking people about her you were told just don’t go  there. 
Diane: There was a zillion other children there why would you want to ask about her but I’d already started asking questions about Daniele. It just really came from the heart. I was drawn to her.
According to the extract, what child did Diane and Bernie adopt?">

<question nquest="2" Question="2. BOEING'S 787  
Norris: .. There was quite a bit of excitement today when Boeing's much-anticipated 787 made a four-hour, eight-minute flight from Tokyo to Hong Kong. Two-hundred-forty passengers were on today's maiden voyage and we were fortunate to track down one of them. His name is Scott Mayerowitz. He's a reporter for the AP. Welcome to the program. 
Scott Mayerowitz: Thanks for having me. 
Norris: Do me a favor, first. Describe this plane. What does it look like? 
Mayerowitz: The very basics -  it's a regular plane. But then you walk inside and there's a sort of open arching space. They call it the dome. And your eyes just naturally gravitate up. And there are sort of sleek edges to everything, nice colors, and you suddenly feel like, oh, maybe this isn't going to be so bad. You walk a few rows back, find your seat and there's a giant window next to you. Yeah, the seat is just the same old uncomfortable seat as you've had for many flights. But you got this big window and you're too busy playing with it..

<question nquest="3" Question="3. Women breadwinners  
NPR: I’m speaking with Lisa Mundy. Her new book is called -The Richer Sex-. And clearly we would presume that if women are earning more and becoming the primary breadwinner that the glass ceiling in the workplace must have dissipated, no?
LM: No, it hasn’t and you know, women working full time still earn eighty-one percent of what men do, that’s all women in all fields. And so the danger is that women will be supporting households on less than a man might make. What’s interesting is (that) even with this earnings disadvantage women are out-earning their husbands .. you know ..a greater percentage every year.

Interviewer: Ruth, why do you think you've been burgled so many times?
Ruth: I wish I knew. It's a nightmare. We bought this house because it looks out onto the playing fields and we thought it was the perfect house for our retirement.
Interviewer: When were you first burgled?
Ruth: Oh, three years ago, just a week after we had moved in. It was as if the burglars were waiting for us.
Interviewer: Do you feel sorry that you moved there now?
Ruth: Oh definitely. If we had known we were going to have this sort of trouble, we wouldn't be living here.  We would have chosen somewhere safer. But now we can't even sell the house because everyone knows the burglars like it! No one will buy it.

<question nquest="5" Question="5. Influential business people  
 Interviewer: So what is it that makes a businessman or business woman influential? 
DS: Well, first we ought to think about what we mean by influential. Lots of business people enjoy success but relatively few become influential, really have an influence, on the people around them, on society, on the world - 
Interviewer. Ok, so who would you say were influential? What names come to mind? 
DS. Well, sometimes it isn’t the names that come to mind, sometimes it’s the product. Obviously we’ve got the big names - Bill Gates, Henry Ford, people like that. Sometimes the names are not familiar at all - like Sam Walton. 
Interviewer: Sam who? 
DS: Exactly! (both laugh) Sam Walton was the man who perfected the idea of the discount store. The Wal-Mart stores are his.

<question nquest="7" Question="7. Regrets   
My biggest regret is how I spent my time at university. I studied English Literature which was something I was quite interested in, but it certainly wasn’t the most important thing in my life. I played a lot of sport, I played in a band and listened to a lot of music, but I also spent most of my time either socializing or asleep. And in terms of studying I just did the bare minimum – I read what I had to, but never anything more. I only went to the compulsory lectures never to the optional ones and I left all my essays until the last minute and kept them as short as I could. OK I passed my exams and I got my degree in the end, but I’ve always regretted not taking advantage of those three years.

Stacey Monroe, who's an executive assistant, does what I do most of the day: She sits at a computer keyboard. 
Stacey Monroe: I am definitely sitting in front of the computer 90 percent of the time. But that other 10 percent is a lot of physical running...  ...through my office to track down my boss, to tell him he's late for a meeting...  ...or that he has a phone call. 
Christine Hart: My name is Christine Hart, and I am a cashier. In my position, I would say I interact with people a lot, especially because I work at a higher-end, sort of typical retail store. You ask people, you know, where they're from, what convention they're in town for, you know, how their day is going so far. So that's probably the most enjoyable part of the job, the small talk.

<question nquest="9" Question="9. A Serb teaches Arab revolutionaries      
The Arab world delivered a surprising message this year. Revolts across the region revealed a generation willing to use non-violent protests to oust unpopular leaders. But that did not surprise Srdja Popovic, a campaigner for non-violent strategies. He was the student leader of a movement that toppled Serbian dictator Slobodan Milosevic in 2000. He also helped train Arab revolutionaries
He seems an unlikely international trouble maker, a lanky biologist from Belgrade, Srdja Popovic preaches the gospel of non-violent struggle to a class at Columbia University in New York. He is passionate about the success of young Arab revolutionaries who came to learn from him in Belgrade
The history really proves that there are fair chances that most of the Arab world will end up in some kind of democracy.

NGOs are facing what some describe as a mid-life crisis. Hard questions are being asked. Should  international  NGOs be a conduit for aid and are they ignorant of local realities, wasteful and undermining of democracy.  As we approach the second anniversary of Haiti’s earthquake we look at the Caribbean country sometimes referred to as the Republic of NGOs.

<question nquest="12" Question="12. Barbie in Iran     
This week, Iranian police took Barbie dolls from shelves across the country and closed dozens of toy shops for selling the iconic American glamour doll. Iran's government news agency quoted an unnamed police official as saying that they were confiscating Barbies as "manifestations of Western culture." Well, Barbie manifests a lot in her full figure, clingy gowns, and revealing bathing suits. In 1996, an Iranian government agency called Barbie the wooden horse of Troy with many cultural invading soldiers inside it. Wait until they see her glitter-boots and little red sports car. Barbie, of course, can lead to Ken and Midge, spangly doll shoes, shimmering dresses; all kinds of other Barbie regalia that many little girls just got to have.

<question nquest="13" Question="14. Viruses and bacteria       
Viruses have a huge impact on our lives – tiny pathogens small enough to be able to hide inside human cells. Infectious and deadly, they are one of the most successful organisms on earth. But why are they so difficult to stop? We’ve had antibiotics, drugs like penicillin, which are effective against a range of bacteria since nineteen twenty-eight. But the first experimental antiviral drugs weren’t produced until the nineteen sixties. So what exactly are viruses, and how do they differ from bacteria? -Viruses are really the very simplest of the micro organisms that cause disease in humans and other animals. A virus is completely inert in the environment. It can’t replicate itself, so if a virus was sitting on a table-top the same virus would be sitting five hours later. There wouldn’t be 10 million of them sitting there. That’s not the same as a bacteria which is able to, in the environment, make copies of itself and expand its numbers.-

<question nquest="14" Question="14. Vietnam draft dodgers       
Thirty-five years ago this week, the US president pardoned thousands of Americans who had evaded the military draft during the Vietnam War. Many of them had fled to Canada to avoid serving as soldiers and until then couldn’t return home. It’s January 1977 and on his first full day in the White House President Jimmy Carter signs a historic decree aimed at healing some of the deep wounds left behind by  the Vietnam War. Jimmy Carter had announced his plans for an unconditional pardon a few months earlier during his campaign for the presidency. His predecessor Gerald Ford had said draft dodgers could only come home if they did two years public works. Either way it was a highly controversial proposal. Allthough draft dodgers could come home, what Carter was saying was that he wouldn’t release those jailed for refusing to serve or forgive those who had deserted the Army.

<question nquest="15" Question="15. Virtual world wonders    
Something that would make the world a better place is a website financed by philanthropists to make available to anyone with access to the internet high quality videos containing guided tours of the world’s most spectacular natural sites, museums, monuments and art and artefact collections. The videos would be narrated by leading experts and translated into as many languages as possible. Through this website seeing the world would cease being the preserve of the rich. At the click of a mouse anyone could go on a virtual helicopter tour of the Grand Canyon, walk virtually through the Louvre or virtually attend a ritual ceremony of the whirling dervishes. With such a website no one would be denied an opportunity to see Vienna’s art treasures merely for lack of money.

We all understand that children need to read, need to enjoy the pleasures of discovery of reading and I think that we all of us understand that that carries on through our entire lifespan. There is perfectly sensible research that gives overwhelming evidence that reading enhances our enjoyment of life our very happiness and indeed our success, it is an essential life skill. We had a short while ago the Booker Prize, a particularly vibrant moment in the bookseller’s calendar sponsored by the Man Group because it focuses a huge amount of interest on the best novels of the moment. The Man Group though also -  and I particularly salute them for this – do an awful lot of further funding and charitable giving around  literacy. They have reacted to the appalling statistics that we have. I think it is currently said that one in six of the adults in this country have difficulty reading.

Melissa Block, host: Vaccinations for children are controversial to begin with, so imagine the concerns surrounding a vaccine for anthrax. The Obama administration is in the midst of a debate over whether to test the existing anthrax vaccine on kids. It's already been tested on adults and administered to millions of members of the military, especially those involved in bioterrorism defense. 
Well, tomorrow, a government advisory group is scheduled to vote on a recommendation that the vaccine be tested on kids. Washington Post science reporter Rob Stein is following the story. And Rob, first of all, remind us just what anthrax is, what it can do. 
Rob Stein: Yeah. Anthrax can be a life threatening infection that's caused by a bacterium that produces a toxin and it can be very, very dangerous and very serious. There are several ways to get exposed to it. You can get exposed to it through your skin, by ingesting it or by inhaling it, which can be the most serious way of getting infected

Melissa Block, host: Well, that Congressional Budget Office report that David mentioned has provided new ammunition for protestors whose signs declare: We Are The 99 Percent. The study found that the richest 1 percent of Americans more than doubled their share of national income in the last 30 years. And the vast majority of the population is getting a smaller slice of the economic pie. 
NPR's Scott Horsley joins us now with more. And, Scott, when it comes to income inequality, how unequal are we? 
Scott Horsley: Well, Melissa, we are getting more unequal. More and more of the income is being concentrated in the top tier. If you go back to 1979, which was the starting point for that CBO study, at that point, the top 20 percent - the richest 20 percent of households - were collecting about 43 percent of all the income in the country. Now, that's over half. 
And a lot of that increase was the very tippy top - the 1 percent at the top of the income distribution. As their share of national income has soared, the share for everyone else - the other 80 percent - has gone down.

<question nquest="21" Question="21. Advertising through children   
A marketing executive talks about using children in advertising
Children are much easier to reach with advertising than adults are – they like it and they pick up on it really fast. So it’s the advertiser’s job to capitalise on this. We have a term, -pester-power-which means the marketing potential of children nagging their parents to spend money. And I’m not just talking about toys here – our aim is getting children to pester parents to buy something for the whole family, like a holiday or a car. The trick is to produce adverts that appeal to both children and adults – to split the message in two.
According to the speaker, in what way can children be used in advertising?

Basically children nowadays are being constantly brainwashed by all the advertising that goes on around them. Usually, the pupils at our school wear uniforms, but Friday is a non-uniform day, and that’s when you really see the power of advertising. The kids are dressed from head to toe in labels, mainly sports stuff like Adidas, Nike, that sort of thing. And they all look the same. There’s a great deal of pressure on parents to buy children all these labels and gadgets. I feel sorry for the families who don’t have much money, because the pressure is just the same.

Gupta served on the boards of both companies and pleaded not guilty earlier today. 
ILYA MARRITZ: Well, Rajat Gupta is one of the best connected businessmen in the country. He was born in India, but he made his career here in the United States. He was managing director of McKinsey and Company from 1994 to 2007. And in that role, he gave advice to captains of industry, people like Jeffrey Immelt at General Electric. 
Later on, he served on the boards of Procter and Gamble, who make household products; and Goldman Sachs, who make financial products. And it was in that role as director of two major publically traded companies that Gupta allegedly passed these secrets to his friend, Raj Rajaratnam, who ran the New York hedge fund. And then, Rajaratnam traded on that information, prosecutors say ..

<question nquest="29" Question="29. What influences food intake ?       
Now the eating habits  we develop early in life can be very hard to change so it’s no wonder that people can struggle to maintain a diet and find it very hard to shift weight that they’ve already gained. Marian Hetherington is Professor of Biopsychology at the University of Leeds where she works on understanding appetite and eating behaviour.  So, Marian, what are the factors that we think influence how we behave towards food?
Well, there’s some evidence to suggest that influences on food intake actually occur very early on in life. In fact inuteral experiences seem to be really interesting and really important. There’s some very elegant data from Joy Monella who’s at the Monel Chemical Census Centre in Philadelphia and she has shown that the foetus is exposed to flavours from the maternal diet. So right from the very beginning of life there’s an experience of flavour, an experience of odours and that these can have an important effect on later food intake.

Most of the world is still enthralled to King Coal. It remains the most abundant fossil fuel, but how long can that continue? Coal is also the dirtiest fuel – dirty to dig up, dirty to burn. Despite its huge impact on the environment and on global warming, the world still relies on coal for much of its electricity and will probably go on doing so. But the balance of energy power is changing and coal in many places is on the defensive. Coal is on the defensive because of its environmental impact, because of the impact of carbon dioxide, CO2 on global warming. And coal is also on the defensive because of the rise of alternative forms of energy. There’s wind power, and solar and now the energy balance of power is being transformed in America now, and in many other places soon perhaps, by huge new natural gas reserves uncovered buy the controversial process of fracking – bringing up natural gas trapped thousands of feet below the ground in shale rock.

<question nquest="36" Question="36. China  
A subject which few Chinese dare to question is now being discussed quite openly all around the country. It’s the notorious one-child policy under which most families are restricted in the number of children they can have. Many are now saying it’s out of date and should be scrapped. The Chinese birth rate has been falling steadily in recent years. In the nineteen eighties there were twenty-five million births a year. Today, that figure, driven down by the policy stands at just fifteen million. Unless the rules are relaxed, some experts believe the population will fall into an irreversible decline.
Which can be said about the one-child policy?

<question nquest="37" Question="37. Monitoring how you drive   
Now it’s bad enough having your partner or your kids monitoring how you drive and offering helpful suggestions but how about your insurance company watching over your shoulder? Aviva is looking for volunteers to install a phone app that records driving habits and creates a profile of your performance behind the wheel. They say it can save up to a fifth of the annual cost of your insurance. In a moment we’ll be looking at other things you could to save  money on your policy but first Steve .. he’s from Aviva. This is a mobile phone app Steve .. what kind of things does it monitor?
Yeah .. hi Peter. It monitors basically your acceleration, braking and cornering so that it basically provides us with an understanding of how people drive..
Couldn’t that end up putting your insurance payments up as well as down..?
Well, the way we’re looking at it is it’ll only drive premiums down .. it gives customers the opportunity to show us what good drivers they are ..

<question nquest="38" Question="38. Tour company  
Interviewer: John Bigos is the managing director of London Duck Tours Limited. This company use Ducks, renovated World War II amphibious vehicles, which can travel on land and water. What makes a Duck Tour better than a normal sightseeing tour?
John: What makes Duck Tours more interesting in terms of the tour as opposed to other tours is the ability to be able to go on the land and the river in one tour at the same time. That has a great benefit for all our clients. We also have a very small vessel which only takes thirty people and that allows you to have a much more intimate relationship with your clients, which makes it a wonderful experience, which you don’t get when you go on ordinary, pre-determined computerized tours.
Which sentence is correct about the man’s company?

<question nquest="39" Question="39. My grandmother   
I really wish I’d been able to know my grandmother better. She died when I was twelve and since then I’ve discovered that she must have been a fascinating person, and there are so many things I would love to have been able to talk to her about. She was Polish but she was in Russia, in St. Petersburg, during the Russian Revolution and she knew all sorts of interesting people at the time - painters, writers, people like that. I was only a child so I never asked her much about her own life. Now I’m discovering all about her through reading her old letters and papers, but I wish she had lived longer so I could have talked to her about those things face-to-face.

<question nquest="40" Question="40. A lost opportunity  
When I was a young man, about seventeen, I was working in Spain as an electrician for the German car company, Mercedes. A man from the engineering company, Bosch, visited Mercedes and he liked the way that I worked and he offered me a job in Germany. I suppose it is what you would call an ‘apprenticeship’. I would have learnt to become an engineer. I really wanted to do it, but my parents didn’t want me to leave home and go and work in a foreign country. In those days, not many people did that. So in the end, I didn’t go. But I really wish that I’d taken that job because I think it would have opened doors for me and my professional life would have been more fulfilling.
