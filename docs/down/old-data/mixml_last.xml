<question nquest="1" Question="35. Photographing food
Now, believe it or not, even Pentagon brownies can be made to look delicious for the cameras. That's what Delores Custer does for a living. She's a professional food stylist. And she's written a book about how it's done. It's called 'Food Styling.' 
And Delores Custer joins me from Portland. Welcome. 
Ms. DELORES CUSTER (Food Stylist; Author, 'Food Styling'): Thank you. 
RAZ: Now, we have all seen the perfect bowl of cereal, right? You know... 
Ms. CUSTER: Mm-hmm.

RAZ: ...the perfect blueberry or the perfect strawberry just hitting the milk. 
Ms. CUSTER: Mm-hmm. 
RAZ: You've got that perfect splash and then these perfectly situated Corn Flakes and they each have a few perfect drops of milk on them. 
Ms. CUSTER: Mm-hmm. 
RAZ: Is that milk? 
Ms. CUSTER: Some of the times, it is. Most of the time, it's not. In the early days, that splash was acrylic. And we would have a model maker make the splash. Today, with digital, it can be a real splash or oftentimes it's illustrated... 
.. Now, if we're selling milk, we have to use milk. If we're selling the cereal, then we sort through and we find what I call flakes with character. ... And we arrange those in a bowl, and then we do use something other than milk if it's going to take the photographer a long time to shoot.

<question nquest="2" Question="36. Sibling rivalry – gas pricing dispute
The case involves the terms of a deal under which Reliance Industries was to supply Reliance Natural Resources, headed by Mukesh Ambani's brother Anil, with a pre-agreed amount of gas for 17 years at a rate 44% below the rate set by the government.
But the court order stated that the government has a right to fix a price for the gas, and that two individuals cannot decide the price of a national asset. The court asked the two brothers to thrash out a fresh agreement within six weeks.
The five-year battle between the billionaire brothers has dominated national news and the verdict in favour of the country's most valuable company is expected to influence trading in the stock markets.
